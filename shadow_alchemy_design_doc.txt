Legend says this was the home of a powerful Alchemist.

The tower was one covered with gold, on every wall, making it attractive for adventurers.
But I belive, there is only one way it would be possible to aquire that much gold.
If you could make it at will.

Also contains the way to eternal life, because everyone who dies in there, doesn't comepletely die.
But turns into monsters.

You delve deeper.
There are three paths you can take.
But it's too dark to see what's ahead.
